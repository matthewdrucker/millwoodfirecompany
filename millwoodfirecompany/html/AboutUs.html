		<p>The Millwood Fire Company protects the citizens of Millwood, New York, 
			a hamlet of the town of New Castle, as well as, a large portion of Chappaqua and Ossining. 
			The Millwood Fire District protects approximately 9.18 square miles and 6000 people in the 
			northern part of Westchester County. We currently are comprised of nearly sixty members, and 
			are actively growing. Responding from two stations, we protect a primarily residential 
			fire district with a handful of commercial developments, as well as an electrical substation. 
			Our neighboring departments include the Chappaqua, Mount Kisco, Briarcliff Manor, Ossining, Yorktown, and Croton Fire Departments.</p>
		<p>The Millwood Fire Company is a private department, whose members are on a volunteer-only status. 
			Responding at any time of the day, our members disappear from their place of work and homes, leaving 
			behind their jobs and families to proudly and professionally protect the Millwood Fire District. 
			The Fire Company currently responds to approximately 300 alarms per year, ranging from automatic 
			alarm activations, and car accidents, to structure fires, and life-threatening situations. 
			The Fire District currently holds a split ISO Rating of 4/9 (East/West side of town). 
			If you have any questions about your ISO rating, please feel free to contact the Millwood Fire District.</P>
		<p>We currently staff and operate 1 Ladder Truck, a 2008 Sutphen (L52) as well as  two engines, 
			a 1998 3D Spartan (Engine 247), and a 2004 Sutphen Spartan (Engine 248). We also operate a 
			1990 Saulsbury heavy rescue with full light, cascade, and extrication systems (Rescue 36). 
			Mini-Attack 10, is a 2012 Ford F550 4 Door 4x4, and our Utility 44 is a 2002 Chevy 2500 heavy duty. 
			In addition, Tanker 15 is a 1995 3D Kenworth carrying 3000 gallons of water.</p>
		<p>The Millwood Fire Company is always looking for new members who are willing to put 
			forth the effort and take a step forward in our community. No prior experience is required, 
			and full state approved training will be provided. Anybody over the age of sixteen and in 
			good health is more than welcomed to fill out an application and proceed to join the Millwood Fire Company and make a difference in our community.</p>
