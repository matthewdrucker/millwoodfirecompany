			<p>Lightening struck the Millwood railroad station one spring day in 1924 and a blazing fire started.
				Area residents attempted to put out the fire, but they did not have the equipment or manpower and
				the Chappaqua fire department was called in to suppress the blaze. To many residents, the railroad
				fire incident underscored the importance of a quick response to a fire in Millwood. Shortly after
				the railroad fire, a dozen families met to start the Millwood Fire Company to meet the suppression needs of our community.</p>

			<p>Land for the Millwood Fire House, located on Route 120, was donated by the Orser family -- 
				long-time residents of the area. The founders of the fire company contributed seed money and solicited 
				area residents for donations to build Station #1 and to buy the 1924 Brockway chemical pumper. Much of 
				the labor to build the firehouse was donated by residents, as many were carpenters and tradesmen.</p>
	
			<p>In the beginning, firefighters were called to alarms by hammering the bell -- still to be seen -- 
				in front of Station #1. That system was soon replaced with an air horn which was later replaced
				with an electronic siren still in use today. </p>

			<p>In the early days, reporting a fire was done by telephone. When a fire was reported, 
				telephones would ring in ten locations including Station #1, Millwood Shell, 
				Demms Mobil, and the private homes of the Fire Company officers. Each of these phones 
				was capable of sounding the air horn at Station #1. Today, a caller can dial 911 to 
				report a fire, and firefighters are dispatched by a portable radio paging/alert system and an audible alarm sounds at the firehouse.</p>

			<p>Millwood Fire Company #1 currently houses two locations: Station #1 located on 
				Route 120 and Station #2 located on Route 134. There are approximately 60 active 
				professional volunteers who respond to over 250 alarms a year. The well-trained 
				company is equipped with seven fire apparatus: two engines, a tanker, 
				a ladder, a heavy rescue, a mini-attack, and a utility vehicle.</p>

			<p>The Millwood Fire Company's goal is to protect the life and property of the Millwood area residents.</p>
